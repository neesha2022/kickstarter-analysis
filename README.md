Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## **Overview of Project:**
Apply excel skills learned in Module 1


## Purpose:
Using the dataset provided, apply excel skills to analyze the data, understand trends, generate reports. Various reports and tables were generated using small subsets of data by applying various filters.

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was done using the dataset in the Kickstarter analysis excel spreadsheet. We started by filtering the outcomes, generating the launch date, comparing the goal amount vs the pledged amount and created various tables. 

The descriptive statistics shows that while Louise is close in meeting the fundraising goal with an average of $5049 and loss of $10,554. 

The challenge was in trying to understand which formula to use when. I know this will take a lot practice. The class also made me look at data from a different lens - how to read data, the kind of information I should be looking for, what questions do I need to ask and thinking of how I can apply it at my work place.  

Installing GIT, GITHUB and using Readme.md was very difficult. To resolve this, I reached out to AskBCS twice. The learning assistants were very helpful. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. May and June had the highest number of successful shows. The number of failed shows has been consistent over the months. The number of failed shows is kind of consistent over all the months. There are a few small bumps. But no big spikes in the chart.

2. After combining the total number of failed and canceled shows, it comes to about  37% of loss of the total number of shows. 
60% of the shows were successful. Without any information on the cost involved in organizing the shows, we cannot know the break even cost to consider how many shows were actually profitable. This will also depend on further breakdown by country and year to understand what other factors affected the success or failure of shows.    
 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The highest number of successful fundraising was in the range of <1000 and between 1000-4999. There are clear outliers for both the lowest and the highest goal amount <1000 had 76% successful rate. While 50k or more had the highest fail rate. But the >$50k goal is still better at 13% than having a 0% success for $45k-$49k. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
-the population size, demographic data is not provided. This would have shown if there was any direct correlation between the demographics and success/failure of the shows
-not having information on the cost involved in organizing/fundraising makes it difficult to predict the profitability of the shows. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Depending on the how you want the data to be represented, you can select the type of graph. 
-Pie chart: We could use the pie chart to see the proportion of Outcomes in the US
-Stacked Bar chart: Comparing the three types of Outcomes with different countries
-Scatter graph: Comparing the category of shows with the launch date

Possible tables:
-Growth of backers over the years
-Calculate ROI for different fundraising campaigns
