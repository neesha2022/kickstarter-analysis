## **Overview of Project:**
Apply excel skills learned in Module 1


To understand their fundraisingLouise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals

### Purpose:
Using the dataset provided, apply excel skills to analyze the data, understand trends, generate reports. Various excel reports and tables were generated to help Louise breakdown the data using small subsets of data.

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was done using the dataset in the Kickstarter analysis excel spreadsheet. The analysis was done by filtering the outcomes, generating the launch date, comparing the goal amount vs the pledged amount. 

The descriptive statistics shows that while Louise is close in meeting the fundraising goal with an average of $5049, there is considerable loss of $10,554. 

Some of the challenges that I encountered is trying to understand what formula to use when. When to use a Pivot table vs the CountIf function. Also how to read data, the kind of information I should be looking for. 

Installing GIT, GITHUB and using Readme.md was very difficult. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May and June had the highest number of successful shows. The number of failed shows has been consistent over the months. Interesting to note that while the highest number of shows were launched in months from April-July, it also had equally high number of failed shows compared to other months. 

Combining the failed and canceled number of events account to upto 37% of loss. 
60% of the shows are successful. Without any information of the cost involved in organizing the shows, we cannot know the break even cost to consider the show profitable. This will also depend on further breakdown by country and year to understand other factors affecting the success or failure of shows

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The highest number of successful fundraising was in the range of <1000 and between 1000-4999. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can create a pie chart to see
